# HTML & CSS Overview

## Objectives

Students should, at the end of the lesson, be able to:

- Explain the service-like nature of the web, and describe interaction between servers and clients.
- Write out the basic skeleton of an HTML page.
- Deploy a basic web page to GitHub Pages.
- Add CSS to an HTML file both by using inline styling, `<style>` tags, and by linking to an external stylesheet with `<link>`.
- Explain at a high level how CSS styling works.
- Write CSS and use it to add styling to a basic page.

## Overview

Let's go over the basics of HTML and CSS! Most of you should have some experience with this stuff already, since you should've all gone through [Dash](dash.generalassemb.ly) and each built a simple website as part of your admissions process.

### What Is The Web?
* The web is a *service*, provided through the electronic telecommunications network known as the *internet*.

  >This is similar to how Netflix's DVD plan operates via the US postal service. The postal service takes care of figuring out how to get parcels from point A to point B - all Netflix has to do is make sure they play by the rules of the system.

* A service always has two kinds of parties involved: **clients**, who make requests, and **servers**, who respond to those requests.
* In the case of the web, the client is the browser - it requests webpages (documents composed of HTML, CSS, and JS) and then "renders" the page for the user to see and interact with.
  > Interestingly, this means that when two people are looking at the same webpage, they are not 'in the same place'; instead they are looking at two separate copies of the same document.

* The HTML, CSS, and JS files provide the blueprint for the browser to build a fully-rendered page.

### HTML
* HTML defines the structure and content of information on the page.
* All HTML pages have the same basic structure:
```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
    <!-- Meta-data goes here. -->
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- Page content goes here. -->
    </body>
  </html>
```
* HTML tags generally come in matched pairs, with the format `<tag> ... </tag>`. The first tag is called the _opening tag_, while the second is called the _closing tag_.
* There have historically been two general kinds of HTML elements: **block** elements and **inline** elements. Block elements have built-in line breaks, causing them to automatically stack vertically, while inline elements don't.
> Below are some examples of block and inline elements. Generally, block elements relate to space on the page, while inline elements relate to text; however, there are exceptions to that guideline. For instance, although `<p>` relates to text, it is actually a block element

| Block | Inline |
|:-----:|:------:|
|`<div>`|`<span>`|
|`<article>`|`<input>`|
|`<header>`|`<strong>`|
|`<p>`|`<a>`|


* HTML5 encourages using "semantic" tags - tags whose names reflect their content and role within the page. Examples of this include `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<nav>`.

#### Lab :: HTML
In pairs, create a new webpage using the raw content found inside `exercise-app/index.html`. Try to use semantic tags where possible.

### CSS
* In the early days of the web, people used to style their pages using explicit styling tags : `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italics, etc. But this was very inflexible - you could only control as many attributes as there were tags.
* CSS emerged in the late 90s as a way to make styling webpages easier. Essentially, its philosophy was to separate styling entirely from each element, and come up with general styling rules that can be applied anywhere.
* The general syntax of CSS is "selector : { some_set_of_style_rules }".
* At a high level, CSS tends to follow two big rules:
  1. More specific selectors beat less specific ones.

    > There is actually a strict scoring system which determines just how 'specific' a selector is, based on its contents: inline style attributes get 1000 pts each; IDs get 100 pts each; attributes, classes, and pseudo-classes get 10 pts each; elements and pseudo-elements get 1 pt each. For a more detailed explanation, see [this blog post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/07/css-specificity-things-you-should-know/) on CSS specificity.

  2. Late instructions overwrite earlier ones - things "cascade".
* To add CSS to a page, either include it
    1. Inline, within an element.
    2. Between two `<style>` tags, typically in the the `<head>` of the document.
    3. In a separate file referred to by a `<link>` tag, also typically in the the `<head>`. The syntax for using a `<link>` tag is `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="...">`, where 'href' is set to the location of the desired stylesheet. (most common)

#### Lab :: CSS
In pairs, take the webpage from the previous exercise and add the following styling to it, using whatever CSS you want:
* Make the recipe title ("The Best Chocolate Chip Cookies") match [this shade of brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shades_of_brown#Chestnut), and make it larger than the rest of the text on the page.
* The font for the whole page should be 'arial', except for the recipe title (which should be in 'cursive').
* All text in the page should be centered.
* In the ingredients list, give each ingredient a unique color; any time that ingredient appears in the recipe, make it that same color. (HINT: use Sublime text's keyboard shortcuts to speed up the process)

#### Bonus (Optional Section)
If you're feeling good about all of this, do some googling and see if you can find a way to style the first letter of every step in the recipe using *only CSS* - no writing new HTML!
